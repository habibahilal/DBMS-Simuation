# DBMS-Simuation

This is a small database engine with support for Octrees Indices. 
The required functionalities are 1) creating tables, 2) inserting tuples, 3) deleting tuples, 4) 
searching in tables linearly, 5) creating an Octree upon demand, and 6) using the created 
octree(s) where appropriate.
